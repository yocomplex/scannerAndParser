The purpose of this school project is for me to become familiar with scanners and a top-down parser. I had to write a scanner and a recursive-descent parser in C++ using classes

****Background****
WHAT THE QUACK! is a programming language devised by the nefarious and villainous Dr. LeQuack with the sinister intention of manipulating and dominating our minds. 
In short, this is an esoteric programming language for when you are wanting to code with ducks. Here is an example:
(This is a program that subtracts 1 from 3. The output is stored in the pond, but it could be displayed to the console if needed
```
. o O
=@      
 ###               
  @< ./././ ./ - 10
###
LeQuack >@
         ###
```
****Test files****
I have provided 5 test files to see how each test case work for the scanner and parser. Feel free to check it out!

****Quick summary****
- Designed and implemented a scanner and a recursive-descent parser in C++ to interpret the esoteric programming language WHAT THE QUACK!, improving understanding of compilers and interpreters.
- Utilized object-oriented programming principles to manage data structures and tokens, ensuring efficient processing of lengthy character sequences in source code.
- Employed C-strings for storage and processing of source code, gaining insights into foundational aspects of how machines handle character strings.
- Developed a scanner capable of reading a file character by character and grouping characters into tokens, with a focus on accurately identifying disembodied ducks in the code.
- Constructed a parser that organizes tokens into syntactic structures based on a context-free grammar (CFG), contributing to the foundational knowledge of syntactic analysis.
- Managed the project within specified guidelines, ensuring simplicity and adherence to the principles of robust software design and error handling.
